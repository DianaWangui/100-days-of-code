# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: November 12, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Started working on Data sructures and algorithms(Arrays). I started with array traversing and insertion. Coded how to traverse an array and how to insert an element in an array, taking it as user input.

**Thoughts:** Honest opinion, it was not that easy especially dealing with insertion, I still have to work on correct positioning of the element without altering the data in the array. Also I think taking an array from user input is not easy as taking normal data, one has to navigate how to make the ouput look like an array. Othewise am loving the challenge.

### Day 2: November 13, 2023
**Todays Progres**: I worked on array deletion, not a complex task actually. Its like a sister to insertion with a few differences.

**Thoughts**: This was not as much as a challenge since I already knew about insertion. It was a matter of understanding the concept of deleting only and boom...

### Day 3: November 14, 2023

**Todays Progress**: I was able to work on linked list, coded about single linked list, that will accept user input and create note as per user requiremet. This means that user can chose to create as many nodes as possible and input data on each node.

**Thoughts**: As much as it seems as an easy task, its not that easy if you dont understand the concept of pointers especially pointers that point to addresses that store data in linked list nodes.
Also tried implementing how data could be printed out as array data, to look like its data that has been stored together, but not yet done. Will update here when its done.

### Day 4: November 15, 2023

**Todays Progress**: I worked on inserting at the beginning and at the end of a single linked list. This was a little bit tricky, traversing through the other nodes can be a little challenges especially end insertion.
You have to be aware of the conditons where the temp is not pointing to a null address.

**Thoughts**: I think the concept of linked list one really needs to use diagrams, to be able to really create lists with having to make simple mistakes especially while traversing

### Day 5: November 17, 2023

**Todays progress**: Today I implement a small employee management system using linked list. Since I have been researching about linked list in it. I also skipped a day, date 16, on my 100 days of code. Trying to make sure it doesnt repeat itself.

**Thoughts**: Linked list is not as easy as other data structures like arrays, but it also has its own advantages of not unnecessarily allocating memeory that will not be used.


### Day 6: November 18, 2023

**Todays Progress**: Worked on my first project today. I want to ensure that I work on project from now onwards. So I implemented a simple password generator.

**How the project works**: This program begins by prompting the user to specify the desired quantity of letters, numbers, and characters for a password. 
Subsequently, it randomly selects elements from each category and shuffles them to generate a unique and secure password. 
The result is an intricately mixed combination of user-specified letters, numbers, and characters, enhancing the password's resilience against potential cracking attempts.

**Thoughts**: This program was easy to develop, as long as you know how to use for loop, list, input function, random import modules.

### Day 7: Novemebr 19, 2023

**Todays Progress**: Worked on the ceasar cipher project. I used python programming, used for loop, list, and python exception to handle errors.

**How the project works**: So here is how the program works, This program serves as a user-friendly encryption and decryption tool. 
Upon initiation, users are prompted to choose between encryption and decryption. For encryption, the user inputs a message and specifies the desired number of shifts.
The program then shifts each character in the message by the specified amount, creating the encrypted output. 
In contrast, decryption involves shifting characters in the opposite direction to reverse the encryption. This straightforward approach allows users to secure and unveil messages with ease.

### Day 8: November 20, 2023

**Todays Progress**: Worked on a silent bidding project. I used python programming, funtion, import module, dictionary if else and while loop.

**How the project works**: 
This program allows users to participate in a bidding like process by entering their names and bid amounts. The user is prompted to provide their name and bid amounts.
 After entering the details, the program stores this information in a dictionary where each user's name is the key with their bid as the value.
To secrecy between bidders, the program clears the screen after each user entry, ensuring that the next user does not see the previous bidder's information. The bidding process continues until a user chooses to exit by entering 'n' for no when prompted. 
Once bidding concludes, the program identifies and displays the highest bidder along with their bid amount to the secreen without showing any information of other bidders

### Day 9: November 21, 2023

**Todays Progress**: Tried working on a simple calculator, managed to create a very basic one for add, subtract, divide and multiplication. I still have few functions I need to work on. This is because I feel like the project needs to work more that it is working now

**How the project works**: It simply ask one to enter their first number, then chose an operator between *, +, -, and /. Then the user is prompted to enter second number. Then it gives the output, then the program asks the user if they want to use the calculator again, loops again until the user choses no.
