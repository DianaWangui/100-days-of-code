# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: November 12, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Started working on Data sructures and algorithms(Arrays). I started with array traversing and insertion. Coded how to traverse an array and how to insert an element in an array, taking it as user input.

**Thoughts:** Honest opinion, it was not that easy especially dealing with insertion, I still have to work on correct positioning of the element without altering the data in the array. Also I think taking an array from user input is not easy as taking normal data, one has to navigate how to make the ouput look like an array. Othewise am loving the challenge.

### Day 1: November 13, 2023
**Todays Progres**: I worked on array deletion, not a complex task actually. Its like a sister to insertion with a few differences.

**Thoughts**: This was not as much as a challenge since I already knew about insertion. It was a matter of understanding the concept of deleting only and boom...

### Day 2: November 14, 2023

**Todays Progress**: I was able to work on linked list, coded about single linked list, that will accept user input and create note as per user requiremet. This means that user can chose to create as many nodes as possible and input data on each node.

**Thoughts**: As much as it seems as an easy task, its not that easy if you dont understand the concept of pointers especially pointers that point to addresses that store data in linked list nodes.
Also tried implementing how data could be printed out as array data, to look like its data that has been stored together, but not yet done. Will update here when its done.

### Day 3: November 15, 2023

**Todays Progress**: I worked on inserting at the beginning and at the end of a single linked list. This was a little bit tricky, traversing through the other nodes can be a little challenges especially end insertion.
You have to be aware of the conditons where the temp is not pointing to a null address.

**Thoughts**: I think the concept of linked list one really needs to use diagrams, to be able to really create lists with having to make simple mistakes especially while traversing
