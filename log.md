# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: November 12, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Started working on Data sructures and algorithms(Arrays). I started with array traversing and insertion. Coded how to traverse an array and how to insert an element in an array, taking it as user input.

**Thoughts:** Honest opinion, it was not that easy especially dealing with insertion, I still have to work on correct positioning of the element without altering the data in the array. Also I think taking an array from user input is not easy as taking normal data, one has to navigate how to make the ouput look like an array. Othewise am loving the challenge.
